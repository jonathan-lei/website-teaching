Jalal has been intrigued by science since a very young age. Fascinated by the natural world, Jalal would spend hours over books reading and learning about different varieties of flora and fauna, extinct and extant. Throughout elementary school, his love for the natural world and its influence on the human race never faded. For example in the 5th grade, Jalal made a project analyzing the influence of Cod on New England’s economy, as well as dedicated his end of the year project to the evolution of life during the Paleozoic era. Jalal also won his school’s geography tournament in the sixth grade. But as his understanding of the world around him grew, so did his awareness of it. Although he can not solve diplomatic disputes, Jalal focuses to improve the community around him.
