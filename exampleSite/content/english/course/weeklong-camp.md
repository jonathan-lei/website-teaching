### Overview

**IMPORTANT: We are working hard to fulfill growing demand, so all current signups will go to our waitlist.**

We are pleased to host a virtual camp! The camp will be hosted Monday-Friday from **August 10-14**. The camp will be run virtually via Zoom. We will run three different classes, each meeting at a specific time every day. Each class will be 1.5 hours long, with a **10-15 minute break** in the middle. There will also be a **30 minute break** between consecutive classes. Students are encouraged to attend all the classes in any given day, however students may choose to attend fewer.

### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this camp! This camp is meant to be an entry-level exploratory experience.

### Schedule

The daily schedule is as follows (Note that each 1.5 hour class will have a 10-15 minute break in the middle of it):

* 10:00 am - 11:30 am: Intro to Python with Game Design
* 12:00pm - 1:30 pm : Lunch Break
* 1:30 pm - 3:00 pm : Scientific Experiments and Discoveries
* 3:30 pm - 5:00 pm : Mathematical Problem Solving and Puzzles

### Time Commitment

1.5-4.5 hours per day for a week (depending on which classes one wishes to attend)
