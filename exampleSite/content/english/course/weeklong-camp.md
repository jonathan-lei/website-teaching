### Overview

Students will attend all of our classes rather than a single one, including [Intro to Java with Processing](/course/intro-to-java-with-processing/) and [Pre-Algebra/Intro to Algebra](/course/pre-algebra-intro-to-algebra-with-intro/) with breaks inbetween for a full and engaging STEM camp experience. 

### Prerequisites

* Students should be eligible for each of the two classes: [Intro to Java with Processing](/course/intro-to-java-with-processing/) and [Pre-Algebra/Intro to Algebra](/course/pre-algebra-intro-to-algebra-with-intro/)

### Time Commitment

* Six hours per day for a week
* Two hours of homework per day for a week

### Cost: Free

Grass STEM is pleased to provide this class for free! However, we highly recommend donations to enable us to expand. All excess profits will be donated to charity.
