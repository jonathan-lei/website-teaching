### Overview

We are pleased to host a virtual camp! The camp will be hosted Monday-Friday from August 10-14. The camp offers instruction on 3 topics: Programming with Python, Introduction to Algebra, and General Sciences. Each day of the camp will have three 2 hour blocks, where each block is dedicated to one of the topics. Python will be offered every day from 10am-12pm, Algebra will be offered from 1pm-3pm, and General Sciences will be offered 4pm-6pm. Each topic will meet 5 times, a block every day.

### Prerequisites

* There are no prerequisites for Python and General Sciences, but basic arithmetic will be needed for Algebra.

### Time Commitment

* 2-6 hours per day for a week (depending on which blocks one wishes to attend)
* Students may attend however many or little blocks to attend. However, it is suggested that they at least attend all 5 blocks of one topic.

### Cost: Free

Grass STEM is pleased to provide this class for free! However, we highly recommend donations to enable us to expand. All excess profits will be donated to charity.
