### Overview

We are pleased to host a virtual camp! The camp will be hosted Monday-Friday from **August 10-14**. Each day of the camp will be split into several 1.5-2 hour blocks, where each block is dedicated to a specific topic. Topics will be based on student interest, which will be gauged by the sign-up form above. Possible topics include math, computer science, general sciences, robotics/engineering, an more. Students are encouraged to attend all the blocks in any given day, however students may choose to attend fewer.

### Prerequisites

* There are no prerequisites for this camp! This camp is meant to be an entry-level exploratory experience.

### Time Commitment

* 2-6 hours per day for a week (depending on which blocks one wishes to attend)
* We recommend students to "shop around" the first day, attending all the blocks. For the rest of the week, students may choose to attend as many or as few blocks based on their interest. They should attend at least one block per day.

### Cost: Free

Grass STEM is pleased to provide this camp for free! We want this opportunity to be available to everyone.
