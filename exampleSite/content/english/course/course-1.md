### Weeklong Camp

From August 10-14 we will be having a 5 day weeklong virtual camp for students in elementary and middle school teaching STEM topics such as computer science, math, and more. Each day will consist of 3 blocks of 2 hours each in which an instructor will teach a topic. Students may choose how many or how little blocks to attend to based on their interest and level.

### Time

* 2-6 hours daily (depending on which blocks you choose to go to) Monday through Friday for a week

### Prerequisites

* Prerequisites will vary depending on which block
* This camp is targeted for beginners so there will definitely be blocks with no prerequisites
* Some blocks may also offer a bit more advanced topics that will require some prerequisites
* Schedule and what will be offered at each block are soon to be determined

### Topics Covered

* Intro to Algebra, intro to Geometry, and MATHCOUNTS training will be offered for math
* Introduction to python and game design will be offered for CS
* More intermediate classes on basic algorithms and data structures will also be offered

### CS Instructor: Steven Tan

Steven has been programming since 6th grade, and has experience in both java and python. He has also competed in many competitive programming competitions and is placed in the Gold Division for USACO (USA Computing Olympiad). Apart from USACO, he also competes in ACSL (American Computer Science League) for his high-schoolâ€™s computer science club. He has experience with python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and has worked on many projects involving processing data.
